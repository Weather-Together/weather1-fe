## 💭 Abstract
WeatherTogether offers an engaging and innovative platform that merges the thrill of gaming with the intriguing world of weather forecasting. At its core, WeatherTogether is an interactive game that draws inspiration from the popular Wordle format, providing users with a unique daily challenge that blends skill, strategy, and a bit of meteorological insight. Upon logging in, players are welcomed into a daily game where they predict weather conditions in various locations around the globe. This initial engagement is just the beginning, as WeatherTogether unfolds its comprehensive suite of features, including competitive matchups and customizable private games, enriching the user experience with diverse gameplay options.

## 📝  Context
WeatherTogether emerged as a capstone project from the creative minds at Turing School of Software & Design, conceptualized and developed by a dedicated team of 2 front-end and 4 back-end students. This project was an ambitious endeavor to expand upon a previously developed idea, with the goal of creating a more interactive and user-friendly experience. The team embarked on this project in week 2 of Module 4 of the Front End / Back End development program, working collaboratively to bring their vision to life.

The project's front end was completely overhauled, utilizing React to create a dynamic and engaging user interface that allows players to easily navigate through the various gaming features. The back end also underwent significant modifications to support new gameplay functionalities and enhance the overall user experience. This included the development of a robust API to manage user data, game statistics, and real-time weather information, providing a seamless integration between the front end and the back end.

The development process was characterized by a highly collaborative approach, with team members working remotely via Zoom and coordinating their efforts asynchronously through GitHub's project board. This collaborative environment fostered a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, enabling the team to overcome challenges and implement innovative solutions.
